# SME Persona — NoorStudio

## Demographics
- **Role:** Parent of 9-year-old daughter (Fatima) who loves writing stories
- **Company type:** N/A (Consumer)
- **Market:** USA, UK Muslim diaspora community
- **Experience level:** Moderate tech literacy, uses Canva, familiar with Amazon KDP

## Context
- **Why they're looking:** Daughter wrote a 20-page story about a Muslim girl detective, wants to turn it into a "real book" to share with cousins and at school
- **Budget:** $50-200 for the project (one-time), maybe $10-20/month if it's a recurring creative activity
- **Time pressure:** Wants to finish by Ramadan (family gift), ~6 weeks away
- **Current solution:** Google Docs for writing, searching "children's book creator" on YouTube, considering hiring Fiverr illustrator ($100+)

## Psychology
- **Trust triggers:** Islamic values visible (modesty in illustrations, no haram content), testimonials from other Muslim parents, preview of final product quality, child-safe platform (COPPA compliance implied)
- **Objections:** 
  1. "Will the illustrations match what my daughter imagined?" (creative control)
  2. "Is this actually going to look like a real book or just a PDF?" (output quality)
  3. "Will it be appropriate for Islamic values?" (content moderation)
- **Decision process:** Solo buyer, but needs daughter's buy-in on the creative output
- **Industry vocabulary:** "publishable quality," "self-publishing," "character design," "illustration styles," "print-on-demand"

## Success Criteria
- **What "done" looks like:** A physical book that daughter is proud to show at school, suitable for gifting to family, reflects Islamic values, looks professionally made
- **Willingness to pay:** $0 to test the concept, $15-30/month if daughter uses it regularly, $50-100 one-time for publishing/printing the finished book
- **Deal breaker:** Output looks "cheap" or "AI-generated ugly," platform allows inappropriate content, too complex for a 9-year-old to use with minimal parent help

## Buying Journey
**Trigger:** Daughter asks "Can we make my story into a real book like in the library?"
**Alternative:** Hire Fiverr illustrator + format in Canva + Amazon KDP (DIY path, $150+ and 3+ weeks of work)
**Decision timeline:** Will spend 15 minutes browsing the platform. If it's not immediately clear how to get from story → book, will leave and try YouTube tutorials instead.
