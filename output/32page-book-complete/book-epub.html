      Once upon a time in the beautiful city of Dubai, there lived a cheerful girl named Amira. She had bright, curious brown eyes and always wore her favorite pink hijab with little golden stars on it.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-02.svg"

         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      Amira lived with her loving parents and her little brother Zaid in a cozy apartment near the Burj Khalifa. Every morning, she would wake up excited for a new day of adventure.

         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      Her best friend was Layla, who lived in the same building. Layla had long dark hair and wore a blue dress with flowers. Together, they were the best of friends.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-04.svg" 
         alt="Page 4 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      One sunny morning, Amira and Layla decided to explore the park near their neighborhood. They had heard tales of a mysterious garden hidden behind the tall hedges.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-05.svg" 
         alt="Page 5 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      'Do you think we'll find it?' Layla asked. Amira's eyes sparkled with determination. 'We won't know unless we try!' she replied with a big smile.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-06.svg" 
         alt="Page 6 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      They walked through the park, past the playground where children laughed, past the fountain where birds splashed, until they found a hidden pathway covered in climbing jasmine flowers.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-07.svg" 
         alt="Page 7 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      The pathway led to a beautiful garden gate covered in vines. 'This must be it!' Amira whispered. Her heart beat with excitement as she gently pushed the gate open.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-08.svg" 
         alt="Page 8 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      Inside the garden was the most amazing sight they had ever seen! Colorful butterflies danced among roses, tulips, and orchids. A small fountain bubbled peacefully in the center.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-09.svg" 
         alt="Page 9 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      Sitting on a bench near the fountain was an elderly woman with kind eyes and a warm smile. She wore a white hijab and waved them over. 'Welcome, young explorers!' she said.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-10.svg" 
         alt="Page 10 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      The woman introduced herself as Grandmother Fatima, the keeper of the secret garden. 'I've been waiting for curious hearts like yours,' she said with a twinkle in her eye.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-11.svg" 
         alt="Page 11 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      'This garden has special flowers,' Grandmother Fatima explained. 'Each one teaches a lesson about being a good person. Would you like to learn their secrets?'
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-12.svg" 
         alt="Page 12 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      Amira and Layla nodded eagerly. Grandmother Fatima stood and led them to a cluster of bright yellow sunflowers. 'These teach us about gratitude,' she said.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-13.svg" 
         alt="Page 13 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      'Just like sunflowers turn toward the sun, we should always turn our hearts toward the blessings in our lives. What are you grateful for, Amira?'
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-14.svg" 
         alt="Page 14 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      Amira thought for a moment. 'I'm grateful for my family, my best friend Layla, and for beautiful days like this!' she said with a bright smile.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-15.svg" 
         alt="Page 15 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      Next, they visited the rose garden. 'These roses teach us about kindness,' Grandmother Fatima explained. 'Even though they have thorns to protect themselves, they give us beautiful flowers and sweet fragrance.'
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-16.svg" 
         alt="Page 16 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      'True kindness,' she continued, 'means being gentle and helpful, even when things are difficult. It means choosing to do good even when no one is watching.'
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-17.svg" 
         alt="Page 17 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      They walked to a patch of lavender flowers swaying in the breeze. 'These teach us about patience,' Grandmother Fatima said. 'See how they grow slowly but beautifully?'
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-18.svg" 
         alt="Page 18 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      'Good things take time,' she explained. 'Whether learning a new skill or growing into our best selves, we must be patient like these lovely flowers.'
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-19.svg" 
         alt="Page 19 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      Near the fountain, they found white jasmine flowers climbing a trellis. 'Jasmine teaches us about modesty and humility,' Grandmother Fatima said.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-20.svg" 
         alt="Page 20 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      'These flowers don't shout for attention, but their beautiful fragrance fills the whole garden. True goodness doesn't need to boast—it speaks for itself.'
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-21.svg" 
         alt="Page 21 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      As the afternoon went on, they learned about the courage of the tall palm trees, the honesty of the clear fountain water, and the generosity of the fruit-bearing orange trees.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-22.svg" 
         alt="Page 22 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      Finally, they reached a special spot where flowers of many colors grew together in perfect harmony. 'This garden's greatest lesson,' Grandmother Fatima said.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-23.svg" 
         alt="Page 23 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      'Just like these flowers are different but grow together beautifully, people from different backgrounds can live together in peace and friendship if they choose kindness and respect.'
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-24.svg" 
         alt="Page 24 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      Amira looked at Layla and smiled. Even though they were different, they were the best of friends. 'I understand now,' Amira said. 'The garden is like the whole world!'
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-25.svg" 
         alt="Page 25 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      Grandmother Fatima smiled warmly. 'You have learned well, dear children. This garden will always be here for you, whenever you need to remember these lessons.'
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-26.svg" 
         alt="Page 26 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      'Can we come back tomorrow?' Layla asked hopefully. 'Of course,' Grandmother Fatima replied. 'The garden welcomes all who seek to learn and grow.'
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-27.svg" 
         alt="Page 27 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      As Amira and Layla walked home through the park, they talked excitedly about everything they had learned. The world seemed brighter and full of possibilities.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-28.svg" 
         alt="Page 28 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      That evening at dinner, Amira told her family about the secret garden and its beautiful lessons. Her parents listened with proud smiles.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-29.svg" 
         alt="Page 29 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      'You've discovered something very special, habibti,' her mother said. 'The most important gardens are the ones we grow in our hearts.'
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-30.svg" 
         alt="Page 30 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      That night, before bed, Amira looked out her window at the stars above Dubai. She thought about all the wonderful lessons: gratitude, kindness, patience, modesty, and harmony.
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page page-break">
    <img src="images/page-31.svg" 
         alt="Page 31 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      She wrote in her journal: 'Today I found a secret garden that taught me how to grow a beautiful garden in my own heart. I will try to practice these lessons every day.'
    </div>
  </div>
  

  <div class="story-page">
    <img src="images/page-32.svg" 
         alt="Page 32 illustration" 
         class="illustration" />
    <div class="text">
      And from that day on, whenever Amira faced a challenge, she remembered the secret garden and the lessons it taught. She grew into a kind, patient, grateful person who made the world a little brighter—just like the flowers in Grandmother Fatima's garden. The End.
